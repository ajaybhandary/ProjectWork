  As a Rhipe program officer
  In order to sign up Rhipe customer successfully,
  I want to be able to fill the sign up form with details


  Scenario Outline: Fill up sign up form with details
    Given Rhipe program officer is on the SignUp page "<Website>" of the website
    When Rhipe program officer fills in all the details of the customer in the SignUp form given 
    Then Rhipe customer will be successfully signed up.
